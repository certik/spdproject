#summary Howto install other packages

You can choose any of the sections below (they are independent), or you can combine them.

== Install numpy, scipy matplotlib and sympy ==

{{{
./spd -i fortran-20071120.p5
./spd -i lapack-20071123.p0
./spd -i blas-20070724
./spd -i atlas-3.8.3.p0    # this is optional but highly recommended: atlas takes a long time to compile, but makes numpy much faster
./spd -i numpy-1.2.0.p0
./spd -i scipy-20071020-0.6.p4
./spd -i matplotlib-0.98.5.3rc0-svn6910.p3
./spd -i sympy-0.6.3.p0
}}}

== Install IPython parallel ==

{{{
./spd -i twisted-8.1.0.p2
./spd -i openssl-0.9.8d.p1
./spd -i pyopenssl-0.6
./spd -i http://spdproject.googlecode.com/files/foolscap-0.3.2.p0.spkg
./spd -i http://spdproject.googlecode.com/files/ipython-bzr1160.spkg
}}}

== Notebook ==

{{{
./spd -i pexpect-2.0.p3
./spd -i twisted-8.1.0.p2
./spd -i setuptools-0.6c9
./spd -i jinja-1.2
./spd -i libgpg_error-1.6.p0
./spd -i libgcrypt-1.4.3.p0
./spd -i gnutls-2.2.1.p1
./spd -i python_gnutls-1.1.4.p3
./spd -i http://spdproject.googlecode.com/files/spd_notebook-3.4.1-2.spkg
}}}

*important*: put a link to the "spd" in your path *and* name it "sage". That is because the notebook does things like `os.system("sage")`, so it has to execute our spd instead.

Run the notebook with:
{{{
In [1]: from sage.server.notebook.notebook_object import notebook
In [2]: notebook()
}}}
