Source Python Distribution (SPD) is a Python distribution and many optional (mainly scientific) packages. Everything fully builds from source on any platform (any linux, Mac OS X, clusters and soon windows).

It is based on Sage, but the standard download has only 2MB and then you only install packages that you really need.

== Installation ==

{{{
$ wget http://spdproject.googlecode.com/files/spd-3.4.2spd2.tar
$ tar xf spd-3.4.2spd2.tar
$ cd spd-3.4.2spd2
$ make
}}}
wait about 10 minutes (tested on Debian, Ubuntu, Gentoo, Fedora, Mac OS X). Then:
{{{
$ ./spd
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Source Python Distribution, Version 3.4.2spd1, Release Date: 2009-05-12 |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.             |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In [1]: from sage.server.notebook.notebook_object import notebook
In [2]: notebook()
}}}

and this will start a notebook in the browser with the standard set of packages preinstalled (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, sympy).

You can also install individual packages by hand, more info at: [http://code.google.com/p/spdproject/wiki/Installation Installation]
