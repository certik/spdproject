Source Python Distribution (SPD) is a Python distribution and many optional (mainly scientific) packages. Everything fully builds from source on any platform (any linux, Mac OS X, clusters and soon windows).

It is based on Sage, but the standard download has only 60MB (and builds in less than 10 minutes) and then you only install packages that you really need (or you can just download the 2MB bare SPD package and install things yourself).

The aim of SPD is to make it easy for anyone to create all in one
distributions with just the packages that we need (e.g. packages that are
currently in SPD, like scipy, numpy, notebook and then bunch of custom
libraries, that don't even have a spkg yet). See this [http://groups.google.com/group/sage-devel/browse_thread/thread/d761c483aa4f9a99 thread] on sage-devel for more information regarding the relation of SPD and Sage.

== Mailinglist ==

Please discuss all related issues on the mailinglist:

and report all bugs to our [http://code.google.com/p/spdproject/issues/list bug tracker].

== Installation ==

{{{
$ wget http://spdproject.googlecode.com/files/spd-3.4.2spd2.tar
$ tar xf spd-3.4.2spd2.tar
$ cd spd-3.4.2spd2
$ make
}}}
wait about 10 minutes (tested on Debian, Ubuntu, Gentoo, Fedora, Mac OS X). Then:
{{{
$ ./spd
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Source Python Distribution, Version 3.4.2spd2, Release Date: 2009-05-15 |
| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.             |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In [1]: from sage.server.notebook.notebook_object import notebook
In [2]: notebook()
}}}

and this will start a notebook in the browser with the standard set of packages preinstalled (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, sympy). To test it, create a new worksheet and type in:
{{{
from math import sqrt
from numpy import array
from scipy.special import erf
from pylab import plot, savefig, grid

A = [0.65435, 2.45106, -1.536643785333E-01, 1.153664378533E+00, 5.0000]
j = array(range(1, 501))
R = 1.*j/(525-j)
corp = -A[4]/R * (A[2]*erf(sqrt(A[0]) * R) + A[3]*erf(sqrt(A[1]) * R))
plot(R, corp, lw=2)
plot(R[100:],-A[4]/R[100:], color=[1,0,0], lw=2, ls='-.')
grid(True)
savefig("a.png")
}}}
this should produce the following plot in the notebook:

(If you are curious what it is, it's an example of an atomic pseudopotential + Coulomb potential.)
