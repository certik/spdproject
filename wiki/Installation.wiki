#summary How to install SPD


This wiki contains older instructions how to install things manually and this is intended for experienced SPD users. If you are new to SPD, please follow the instructions on the front page: http://code.google.com/p/spdproject/

= Download =

{{{
wget http://spdproject.googlecode.com/files/spd-3.4.1.beta4.tar.gz
}}}

== Installation ==

{{{
tar xzf spd-3.4.1.beta4.tar.gz
cd spd-3.4.1.beta4
SAGE_FORTRAN=/usr/bin/gfortran make
}}}

This is the bare package, that doesn't have any functionality.

== Install the minimum packages ==

If you have more than one processor (e.g. 8), use
{{{
export MAKE="make -j9"
}}}

The very least you want to install is:
{{{
./spd -i termcap-1.3.1.p0
./spd -i zlib-1.2.3.p4
./spd -i readline-5.2.p6
./spd -i python-2.5.2.p9
./spd -i ipython-0.9.1
}}}

*Note*: See the current list of the [http://www.sagemath.org/packages/standard SAGE packages] in case a download fails. It is usually sufficient to increase the release number (the last digit).

Then:
{{{
$ ./spd 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.               |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In [1]: 
}}}


== Next steps ==
