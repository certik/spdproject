#summary How to install SPD

= Download =

{{{
wget http://spdproject.googlecode.com/files/spd-0.3.tar.gz
}}}

== Installation ==

{{{
tar xzf spd-0.3.tar.gz
cd spd-0.3
SAGE_FORTRAN=/usr/bin/gfortran make
}}}
Note: the last line will say "...sage: not found". That's ok, ignore it.

This is the bare package, that doesn't have any functionality.

== Install the minimum packages ==

If you have more than one processor (e.g. 8), use
{{{
export MAKE="make -j9"
}}}

The very least you want to install is:
{{{
./spd -i termcap-1.3.1.p0
./spd -i zlib-1.2.3.p4
./spd -i readline-5.2.p6
./spd -i python-2.5.2.p9
./spd -i ipython-0.9.1
}}}

*Important*: delete now your Sage dot directory, otherwise SPD will not install it's modified ipython rc files and it will not work (you need to do this only once):
{{{
rm -rf ~/.sage/
}}}

Then:
{{{
$ ./spd
